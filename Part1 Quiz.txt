Part 1 - Quiz. Can't use internet for these questions. Or visual studio
1. What is SOLID. List all 5
--S-Single Responsibility - not more than one reason for class to change
--O-Open closed - Open for extensions but closed for modification
--L-Liskov substitution - extension of open close principle ... making sure extended classes doesn't change base classes behavior
--I-Interfaces - more small ones rather than one big one
--D- dependency inversion

2. What is the difference between struct and class
//Struct - For data, can't be null 
//Class - can have methods as well and can be null

3. List Data structures in c# e.g. List, ... 
--List, Array, Dictionary, 

4. What is sealed, abstract and virtual keywords 
Sealed - can't be inherited
Abstract - it must be inhereted, it can't create new abstract class for example as var
Virtual - allows you to overwrite it later (method) - if ti's not virtual I can override 

5. What are the different access modifiers in c# (e.g. private). And what do they do
--Private - can be accesed only inside a class
--Public - can be accesed inside as well as ousie a class, can be accesed in other project 
--Protected - acesible inside the class and in other classes that derive from this class
//internal - can be accesed only in this project

6. What is the difference between "const", "static" and "static readonly" keywords
--Const - it's value is constant, we have to assing some value to it
--static readonly - the value can be changed but only in constructor
--static - 

7. Write a line of code that throws an exception
--int.Parse("asdf"); //We would have to use int.TryParse("asdf") to not get exception

8. When should you use stringbuilder 

9. What is the CLR - Common Language Runtime

10. Why are strings immutable

11. What is diff between GetType(), is and typeof()

12. How is a dictionary implemented
--it's using a hash table and hash function, this function create hascode that is saved in array

13. What is the Equals/hashcode contract. Aka why are the equals() and hashcode() important on every class and important in dictionary.

14. What happens when there is a collision in a dictionary

15. What is a constructor. Write code for an example
Constructor is a method that gets called as first when class is called 

 public class Example
    {

        public Example()
        {
		//Code that will get called first
        }

16. What is the difference between method overloading and overriding. Give an example of each 
--Overriding is when we have a base class with method and class derived from it with same method ... these two methods will override eachother
--Overloading is when we have methods with same names, but different variables

17. What is the main entry point of a c# application 
--The first method that is called after running c# app is Main method in Program.cs

18. What is TDD? Explain the 3 steps in it. 
--using/writing unit tests while coding

19. Explain difference between ref and out keywords in C#
ref- allows you changed the value within the method
out- can be return more than one outputs

20. What is the output for executing the following code?
public class TestClass
{
    private string a = "Unchanged";
    
    private void TestMethod(string b)
    {
        var newString = "Changed in TestMethod";
        b = newString;
        Console.WriteLine(b);
    }
    
    public void RunTest()
    {
        TestMethod(a);
        Console.WriteLine(a);
    }
}
var test = new TestClass();
test.RunTest();

--There will be "Changed in TestMethod" written twice in Console



--Counter

    class Counter
    {
        private static int _count;
        public Counter()
        {
            _count++;
        }

        public int GetCount()
        {
            return _count;
        }
    }
